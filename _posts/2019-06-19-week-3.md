I was also out this day for the tours at the Kuwahee, MBW, Labs and UGC Departments. The most interesting thing about this tour was the labs department. They showed us what they do, and all the equipment they use to do said things. The interesting of said tour was when they showed us these microrganisms on a monitor. They were long, short, big, and small. The coolest one I saw was the Waterbear which is a small fat microrganism that actually has legs (who would've known). Overall the tour was quite enjoyable except for the wastewater plants since they weren't that great (smell wise).
