My first week working for ISD lasted 3 days. In these 3 days I was given the task of setting up my computer. 

Day 1: I set up my computer physically with the help of my coworker Nick. After that I was to setup up my computer with the needed programs to be able to help projects. There was a lot of trial and error, but with the help of everyone I was able to push through.

Day 2: I still had a bit to go with setting up my computer. I set up programs like ConEmu, Visual studio code, and Eclipse. Everything went fine for the most part.

Day 3: At this point I'm alnost finished with setting up my computer, and everything is going good for the most part. Until I run into an error with trying to set something up in Eclipse. I get Nick to come and help me, but we're stuck. So, we then get matt to try and figure out whats going on, but before we could get far I had to leave due to using up my alloted hours for the week.
