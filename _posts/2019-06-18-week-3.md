For this day I spent most of my time touring the Hoskins Center. It was overall pretty neat to see all of these departments, and see what they do/how they function. The most interesting thing I saw during the tours was in the ISD room. The person presenting (sorry I can't remember his name) showed us how the ISD deals with security. He pointed to the board which showed a long list records of cyber attacks. He proceeded to talk about how countries like Russia and China try to send out cyber attacks on companies like KUB to try and get their information. He then talked about this cool thing called a firewall which prevented most of this attacks. Overall it was pretty cool to learn more about what ISD does.
