My second week working for ISD lasted for 4 days. The task I had for these 4 days was to learn html.

Day 5: At the start of this day we went back to try and figure out the issue with Eclipse. Matt tried mutiple things to troubleshoot Eclipse, but nothing worked. He then told me to uninstall it, and he would send me a different version of Eclipse. After that I re-calibrate Ecipse and try to do it again, but it ultimately fails. So, we scrap trying to learn web-api and he puts me on the task of learning HTML.

Day 6: I looked over the HTML tutorial, and took notes on it.

Day 7: Same as the day before, but started messing around with starting a blog with jekyll.

Day 8: Took more notes on HTML, and set up my jekyll blog.
