So, today I was asked to go and look back at the HTML tutorial, and refresh my memory to get a better understanding of what work is going to be like for me. I've taken some more notes and relooked over a some things, and I think I got (some) it now. I'm also going to be at a retirement party for Kevin Fox who has served 30 years at KUB which is mindblowing to someone like me.
