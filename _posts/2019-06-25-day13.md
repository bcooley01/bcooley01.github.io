So, today I went to a manager roundtable where we teenworkers got to talk with the managers of KUB's departments. It was a nice experience talking with these people as they told us about they're experiences and lives. We got to ask questions like how their days usually are, how long they've worked there, or what they like most about their job. Overall I enjoyed this networking experience because it exposed me to people who have worked at KUB for like 20+ years, and still enjoy it (ha ha), but to get back on point this was a really good session, and I would love to do it again.

Also R.I.P to my favorite youtube streamer Etika who lost the battle to mental health.
